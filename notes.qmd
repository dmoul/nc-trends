# Notes {.unnumbered}

I'm grateful to the people and organizations providing the open data and tools that I used, including the following:

* The [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov) for it's exacting work over the decades and the high-quality data they make available freely.
* [National Historical Geographic Information System](https://www.nhgis.org) (NHGIS) for U.S. Census data. It's one of the projects of [IPUMS](https://www.ipums.org), which "... provides census and survey data from around the world integrated across time and space. IPUMS integration and documentation makes it easy to study change, conduct comparative research, merge information across data types, and analyze individuals within family and community context. Data and services are available free of charge."
* [tidycensus](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/) and [tigris](https://github.com/walkerke/tigris) R packages make it easy to download US Census demographic and geometry data from APIs provided by the Census Bureau.[
* North Carolina Department of Public Instruction, which makes [school report cards](https://www.dpi.nc.gov/data-reports/school-report-cards) and related data [available for researchers](https://www.dpi.nc.gov/data-reports/school-report-cards/school-report-card-resources-researchers).
* US Geological Service (USGS) for an NC excerpt of the [National Map](https://apps.nationalmap.gov/viewer/) and a map of the southeastern states' geological regions.
