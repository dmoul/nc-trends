# Questions

## Data questions

Using tidycensus to get census data and geometry data

* Which demographic data fields exactly?

* From which census data sets?

* Over which years
  - ideally: 1990, 2000, 2010, 2020

* Which areas: census tracts? counties? PUMAs? zip codes?
  - How consistent are the areas over 30 years?
  - not PUMAs
  - let's start with counties, since (1) boundaries haven't changed since 1990 (I assume!); and (2) it's less data


## Implementation questions

* How do I safely add my census key? Double-check what I did before.
 -  Use census_api_key() to add your free CENSUS API key to your .Renviron

* Should I use targets? Is it worth the overhead? Probably.

* Will tidycensus really cache data when using quarto? It didn't seem to be doing that in my nightlight project

## Analysis quesitons

What is the best way to represent ordered categories of data in a geographical data set?
  - example: under 18, 18-65, over 60 for each area, for each census
  
Should I make this a shiny app, so it's easier for the user to switch among dimensions of data? If so, where would I host the output?

Should I use observablejs to add interactivity? Will github.io present it OK?
