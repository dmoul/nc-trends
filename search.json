    "text": "Introduction\nInspired while reading North Carolina beyond the connected age: the Tar Heel State in 2050 by Michael L. Walden, I decided to explore and visualize demographic aspects of NC, limiting myself to current and historical data from the US Census Bureau and the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction. I have not dabbled in future projections, since the significant changes over the last 20-40 years provide plenty to think about.\nAs I write this in late 2022 and early 2023, significant portions of the 2020 Census data are not yet available. For 2020 and 2021 data I used the 2020 decennial “PL” data released for use in redefining the nation’s political maps (“redistricting”) along with the five-year American Community Survey (ACS) ending in 2019 or 2021 and ACS 2021 monthly estimates (aggregated to yearly amounts). Education data comes from the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction.\n\n–Daniel Moul"

    "text": "4.1 NC population structure\nThe population distributions of racial groups for the whole of North Carolina vary quite considerably.\n\nSince blacks and whites make up about 93% of the state population, the “all_races” distribution looks a lot like the ones for these groups. The shape indicates populations that are modestly declining.\nThe Asian distribution bulges in the late twenties through early forties, consistent with immigrant communities that are recent or don’t have large families.\nThe Native American distribution shows on-going modest growth.\nThe “two or more races” distribution is most striking: a large, bottom-heavy pyramid indicates a very youthful, growing population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: NC population structure by race for entire state\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to interpret these plots\n\nEach bar is a five-year age group with the bottom one being ages “0 to 4”. The top segment is ages “85 and above”. Male and female bars go to the left and right respectively, enabling a rough visual estimate of whether one sex has more people than the other in each age group (as is visible in Figure 4.9 and Figure 4.10). Traditionally the Census Bureau counts two genders; they started collecting more nuanced answers in 20211. Horizontal dashed lines roughly indicate the milestones of adulthood and retirement.\nEach sub-plot represents the population distribution of one racial group (or “all_races”). Bars measure each age group’s proportion of that racial group’s population rather than number of people. Since blacks and whites make up such a large proportion of NC county populations, plotting counts would result in shapes so skinny that they would be uninterpretable. Thus the shape of the distributions are comparable but not the magnitude of the populations––one cannot infer relative proportion across sub-plots by comparing the width of the bars in an age category.\nLarge margins of error and differential privacy for small subgroups has the most impact here, so focus on the general shape, not the exact growth rate for any population segment. I don’t plot distributions for racial groups with less than 500 people in a county.\nThe various shapes point to likely trends, ignoring future net inflows or outflows or changes in family size. Imagine the shapes moving upwards through the years: shapes with a narrower base than middle (white and black) are likely to decline in absolute numbers as people die. Shapes with a wider base (two+, nativeam) are likely to keep growing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.1 Regions\nAggregating population age groups to the regional level, distributions are generally similar with the exception of the coastal region where the influence of military bases is evident (see Figure 4.3). At this summary level, racial group differences are more pronounced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: NC population structure by race summarized by region\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Military bases\nIn these counties one or more military bases supply “extra” people mostly in their twenties. A characteristic bar juts out to the left indicating an unusually large portion of young men in their early twenties. Onslow, home of Camp Lejeune and Marine Air Station New River, is especially unbalanced overall while the pattern varies by racial group. For example, among Asians in Onslow there are disproportionally many males in their twenties and females in their forties and fifties, and similar patterns exist in Cumberland and Wayne counties.\nCounties with the largest military bases:\n\nCraven (Marine Air Station Cherry Point)\nCumberland (Fort Bragg and Pope Air Force Base)\nHoke (Fort Bragg)\nOnslow (Camp Lejeune, Marine Air Station New River)\nWayne (Seymour Johnson Air Base)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: NC population structure by race in counties with military bases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Colleges and universities\nSimilar to counties with military bases, these counties have a bars that jut out representing young people at college–both male and female. In universities with a lot of graduate students, the extra width starts or continues in the years beyond 25.\nCounties with large college and university student populations are listed below. The population distributions show horizontal bars around age 20 if the students are a relatively large portion of the people in their lower twenties:\n\nCumberland (Fayetteville State University and Methodist College)\nDurham (Duke University and Medical Center, North Carolina Central University)\nJackson (Western Carolina University)\nMecklenbug (UNC Charlotte, Queens University of Charlotte, Johnson & Wales University Charlotte Campus)\nNew Hanover (UNC Wilmington)\nOrange (University of North Carolina main campus and UNC Hospitals)\nPitt (East Carolina University)\nWake (North Carolina State University and Meredith College)\nWatauga (Appalachian State University)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: NC population structure by race in counties with colleges and universities\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Mecklenburg and Wake counties, the university populations are small relative to the whole counties, so their plots lack the characteristic bump in the late teens and early twenties.\nIn Figure 4.4 we see gender imbalance among certain racial groups in some counties, for example:\n\nWhite males in Cumberland county (likely due to military bases)\nAsian and “two+” female students in Watauga county (likely reflecting campus composition at AppState)\n\n\n\n\n4.1.4 Retirement-heavy counties\nThe population distributions of these counties include a characteristic bulb in the ten years or so before and after retirement. This is most common among whites and in counties with some of the smallest, rural populations. The Asian, Native American and two or more groups typically make up a very small proportion of these counties’ population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: NC population structure by race in counties with large retiree communities - part 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.6: NC population structure by race in counties with large retiree communities - part 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.5 With more youth than is typical in NC\nThe “echo” of families with children are evident when there is a narrow waist followed by a wide foot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.7: NC population structure by race in counties with more youth than is typical in NC counties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.6 Missing youth or college age\nA narrow “waist” at age 20 or a very narrow foot indicates a relative dearth of young people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.8: NC population structure by race in counties missing youth or college age\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.7 Counties with large gender imbalance\nGender imbalances have many causes, including (1) immigration patterns (do men and women immigrate in similar numbers in similar age groups?); (2) institutional draws (schools, military, correctional facilities); (3) employment draws; and (4) old-age survivorship rates. In North Carolina the most visible gender imbalances can be found in Asian and black groups in a subset of counties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.9: NC population structure by race in counties with large Asian gender imbalance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.10: NC population structure by race in counties with large black gender imbalance"

Most noticeable in Figure 5.4 below are the points aligned with the sides of the triangle. For example, the number of black students is “masked” for schools where there are less than 10 black students taking the End of Course (EOC) exams1, and a point representing this lays along the left edge representing zero percent black. Similarly, points aligned along the right of the triangle are schools with masked number of White students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: School racial mix - ternary\n\n\n\n\n\nSome points are overplotted.

    "text": "5.5 School performance grades\nA condition of funding by the U.S. Department of Education is that schools report performance to hold them accountable to parents, their communities and the U.S. Department of Education. No Child Left Behind specified certain “accountability subgroups” for which performance had to be reported, if if targets were not met federal funding would be reduced. Amended in 2016 as part of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) the regulations were published in the Federal Register on Nov 29, 20163:,\n\n… requires each [State educational agency] SEA to have an accountability system that is State-determined and based on multiple indicators, including, but not limited to, at least one indicator of school quality or student success and, at a State’s discretion, an indicator of student growth.\n\nThus the NC Department of Public Instruction publishes school report cards. I use data from 2019, because (1) the NC DPI’s “analytic section” was decommissioned in 20204; and (2) reporting certain data became optional during the COVID-19 pandemic5.\nThe primary indicator of school performance I use below is the school performance score published by the North Carolina DPI Office of Accountability and Testing. The Technical Guide for School Accountability and Testing Results6 defines the main components of the score as follows:\n\n1.4. School Performance Grade Indicators for High Schools\nThe high school model applies the weights in the system, where growth is 20% of the model, and the remaining indicators, Academic Achievement and School Quality Student Success indicators, are 80%.\nThe high school indicators making up 80% of the model are as follows:\n\nEnd-of-Course Tests – Students that score at or above Level 3 on four End-of-Course\n(EOC) assessments – NC Math 1, NC Math 3, English II, and Biology – are counted for performance. NC Math 1, NC Math 3, and English II are also counted for growth. Biology is not part of growth. The NCEXTEND1 is an alternate assessment for students with disabilities instructed in the NC Extended Content Standards and is included in performance only, not in growth.\nCohort Graduation Rate – The percentage of students who graduate within the defined cohort in four years or less.\nEnglish Learner Progress – Students who are classified as English earners take an English language attainment assessment which is included in the accountability model for students in grade ten.\nMath Course Rigor – The percentage of grade twelve students passing the NC Math 3 course.\nThe ACT/WorkKeys – The percentage of grade twelve students meeting either the University of North Carolina System’s admissions minimum requirement on a college admissions assessment (a composite score of nineteen on The ACT) or who meet the standard, earning a certificate at the Silver, Gold, or Platinum level, on a nationally normed test of workplace readiness (ACT WorkKeys assessments).\n\n\nThe NC DPI assigns grades based on the scores; I use the numerical scores instead, since they are more informative and are better suited for plotting and regression analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.8: Map of NC school performance grade scores in 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cumulative distribution plot of school performance scores plotted below are summarized by the school district (purple) and shown individually for all schools (green). As one would expect, the school district averages are not as extreme. Above the median there is a noticeable divergence between top-performing schools and school districts, which is a reminder that the performance of schools within a single school district can vary quite a lot.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.9: NC school performance grade scores in 2019 - density and cumulative distribution by school districts and schools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.5.1 School accountability subgroups and school performance scores\nAlso noted in the amended regulations published in the Federal Register on November 29, 20167:\n\n…Consistent with section 1111(c)(2) of the ESEA, the regulations require that a State include certain subgroups of students, separately, when establishing long-term goals and measurements of interim progress under § 200.13, measuring the performance on each indicator under § 200.14, annually meaningfully differentiating schools under § 200.18, and identifying schools under § 200.19. These subgroups of students include economically disadvantaged students, students from each major racial and ethnic group, children with disabilities, as defined in section 8101(4) of the ESEA, and English learners, as defined in section 8101(20) of the ESEA. However, the statute does not prohibit a State from using additional subgroups in its statewide accountability system, which may include combined subgroups. We also believe it is appropriate for States to retain flexibility to include various additional subgroups, based on their contexts, so long as each required individual subgroup is also considered. Accordingly, we are not revising the regulations….\n\nI show data for most of these subgroups:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Subset of school accountability subgroupsused in this analysis\n    \n    \n    \n      subgroup\n      description\n      n_schools\n      in_subset\n    \n  \n  \n    ALL\nAll Students\n519\nY\n    AM7\nAmerican Indian\n12\nY\n    AS7\nAsian\n57\nY\n    BL7\nBlack\n342\nY\n    EDS\nEconomically Disadvantaged\n476\nY\n    ELS\nEnglish Learners\n146\n\n    HI7\nHispanic\n338\nY\n    MU7\nTwo or More Races\n118\nY\n    SWD\nStudents with Disabilities\n346\nY\n    WH7\nWhite\n460\nY\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.10: School performance score by subgroup (boxplot)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.11: School performance score by subgroup and region (boxplot)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.10 and Figure 5.11 show large differences in the distribution of school performance scores by subgroup and region.

    "text": "6.1 Introduction\nIncome is associated with school performance, however it doesn’t tell the whole story. There are significant disparities in educational outcomes for racial/ethnic subgroups and other “accountability groups” as noted in the chapter NC Education Section 5.5.1. Below I look at the associations of income, subgroup, and region with school performance: visually and numerically.\n\n6.1.1 Income and earnings\nThe five-year ACS ending in 2019 includes a number of variables related to income and earnings. I use the following:\n\nB07011_001 (Median income in the past 12 months; universe: Population 15 years and over in the United States with income)\nB19301_001 (Per capita income in the past 12 months; universe: Total population). For per capita income by race I use “B19301A_001” through “B19301G_001”.\nB20004_001 and related variables (Median earnings in the past 12 months; universe: Population 25 years and over with earnings) by level of educational attainment (and all education levels)\n\nAll are estimates in 2019 dollars with geographical boundary of “county” or “school district (unified) as indicated”1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote on estimates\n\n\n\n\n\nData are estimates from the US Census five-year American Community Survey (ACS) results ending in 2019. At the time I am doing this analysis (Nov/Dec 2022), this was the latest reliable data available: detailed 2020 decennial census income data had not been released, and 2020 ACS results were less reliable than usual due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ACS estimates have much larger margins of error (MOE) than the decennial census. In small sub-populations MOEs can exceed estimated values. To simplify the presentation in this chapter I have not represented this uncertainty in most cases; instead I use the estimates as given. An exception is Figure 6.4.\n\n\n\n\nRelevant ACS definitions of some measures of income2:\n\nIncome of Individuals – Income for individuals is obtained by summing the eight types of income for each person 15 years old and over. The characteristics of individuals are based on the time of interview even though the amounts are for the past 12 months.\nMedian Income – The median divides the income distribution into two equal parts: one-half of the cases falling below the median income and one-half above the median. For households and families, the median income is based on the distribution of the total number of households and families including those with no income. The median income for individuals is based on individuals 15 years old and over with income. Median income for households, families, and individuals is computed on the basis of a standard distribution.\nPer Capita Income – Per capita income is the mean income computed for every man, woman, and child in a particular group including those living in group quarters. It is derived by dividing the aggregate income of a particular group by the total population in that group. (The aggregate used to calculate per capita income is rounded.\nMedian Earnings – The median divides the earnings distribution into two equal parts: one- half of the cases falling below the median and one-half above the median. Median earnings is restricted to individuals 16 years old and over with earnings and is computed on the basis of a standard distribution. Median earnings figures are calculated using linear interpolation.\n\nAnd as noted at censusreporter.org3:\n\n…in Census Bureau terminology, earnings are a subset of income. Specifically, earnings are wages or salary from a job, or income from being self-employed. Other kinds of income, not included in earnings, include social security payments, interest and dividends, income from property rental, pensions, public assistance, and child support."

    "text": "6.4 School performance score and median income (school district aggregation)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs there a change in score associated with a change in median income of the people living the school district catchment area? Yes. As seen in Figure 6.6, scores increase as median income increases, however this is a smaller factor than racial/ethnic group, being economically disadvantaged, or being a student with a disability. Income is confounded by membership in racial/ethnic and economically disadvantaged subgroups, which are partially a proxy for income (which is not visible in this data set). And as we can see in Figure 6.7, region is a partial proxy for income too.\n\nThere are three clusters: (1) Students with disability (SWD) have a unique set of challenges, and their trend line is distinct from the other subgroups; (2) black (BU7), Native American (AM7), Hispanic (HI7), multiple races (MU7), and Economically disadvantaged (EDS); and (3) Asian (AS7) and white (WH7). These categories are overlapping: a student may belong to two or more subgroups.\nThe composite “All” subgroup is closest to the white (WH7) grouping, since in the majority of schools the white population is a large majority.\n\n\n6.4.1 Score by median income (school district aggregation)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.6: School performance score by median income\n\n\n\n\n\nThe patterns generally hold up when faceting by region.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.7: School performance score by median income by region\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.4.2 Score by per capita income (school district aggregation)\nThe picture is different when looking at per capita income (PCI) instead of median income. In contrast to median income, (1) PCI varies by subgroup; and (2) there is less overlap in income ranges. Note that the PCI universe is not bounded by age, so subgroups that on average have larger families will have lower PCI. These differences in PCI by subgroup may be confounded by the mix of education levels in each group (data that would confirm this is not at hand).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.8: School performance score for subgroups by per capita income\n\n\n\n\n\nThe patterns generally hold up when faceting by region, however the trend lines do not; likely this is due to the narrower income bands of the subgroups.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.9: School performance score for subgroups by per capita income by region"

Simpler explanations (i.e., fewer independent variables) are better than more complex ones and are less likely to overfit the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.5.1 Summary: strongest associations\nThe strongest associations are the following:\n\nMedian income (\\(income\\)) with years of education (\\(years\\_ed\\_centered\\)). \\(R^2 = 82\\%\\)\nPer capita income (\\(pci\\)) with \\(subgroup\\). \\(R^2 = 52\\%\\)\nSchool performance score (\\(spg\\_score\\)) with \\(subgroup\\). \\(R^2 = 52\\%\\)\n\nThe details are below.\n\n\n6.5.2 Median income\nThe baseline model \\(income \\sim years\\_ed\\_centered\\) explains 82% of the variance, and adding \\(subgroup\\) or \\(n\\_student\\) doesn’t help much. Neither \\(region\\) or \\(subgroup\\) are useful. The bars show 90% confidence intervals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.10: Models predicting median income\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.5.3 Per capita income\n\\(pci\\) has the potential to be interesting, since it varies by racial \\(subgroup\\). Do we see it in the numbers? Yes. The baseline model \\(pci \\sim subgroup\\) explains 52% of the variance, and adding \\(n\\_student\\) doesn’t help much. \\(years\\_ed\\_centered\\) is not useful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.11: Models predicting PCI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.5.4 School performance score\nCan we find meaningful associations with school performance grade score? Yes, but like \\(pci\\), not as strongly as median \\(income\\).\nA very simple model is again the best: \\(spg\\_score \\sim subroup\\) explains 52% of the variance.\nHere we see the same three clusters of subgroups as noted in the plots in Section 6.4.\nWhat about \\(pci\\) instead of median \\(income\\)? \\(R^2\\) is 0.31 and adding \\(subgroup\\) raises \\(R^2\\) to 0.42, which is less explanatory than using \\(subgroup\\) alone.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.12: Models predicting spg_score\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if we look only at economically disadvantaged students (EDS)? There is a weak association: the higher the percentage of economically disadvantaged students in a school, the lower the \\(spg\\_score\\). As seen in Models and model parameters the model \\(spg\\_score \\sim pct\\_student\\) using the data_grouping EDS explains only 4% of the variance in \\(spg\\_score\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.13: Considering only the economically disadvantaged student subgroup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.5.5 Models and model parameters\nThe table below lists regression models and their key parameters. Some notes:\n\nThe mean years of education is 14.2 based on the informal mapping I created (see Years of education (school district aggregation)); \\(years\\_ed\\_centered\\) is the number of years +/- from this average. Thus when using \\(years\\_ed\\_centered\\) in a regression model, for example \\(income \\sim years\\_ed\\_centered\\), the intercept indicates the income at the mean years of education.\nRegression models that use \\(subgroup\\) as a term provide an estimate (for each subgroup) of the difference it makes after considering the reference subgroup, which does not show up in the list of regression estimates. In this case the reference subgroup is “AM7” American Indian and Native Alaska (aka “native_am”).\n\\(n\\_student\\) is the number of students in a school taking the end of course (EOC) exams. In addition to using it in some regressions, it provides a relative size of the schools and is helpful when calculating district-wide summaries using weighted means.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    \n

Some explorations petered out, others “graduated” in the data transformations and visualizations included here. I haven’t gone back to clean out the functions, scripts, and data I decided not to use.\nNHGIS terms of use are that every consumer should get the data from them directly. I haven’t gone back to create simple, shareable documentation of what data I downloaded.\nEven if the terms of use allowed all the data to be shared, there is too much to upload it to GitHub.\n\nSo if you are interested in learning from this analysis I hope reading the scripts and rerunning ones that get data directly (tidycensus, tigris) will get you far enough to be helpful."
